--Including the expected input and output types
--And then the expression to define the function, add_one
add_one :: Natural -> Natural
add_one = \x -> x + 1

-- :: specifies the type for add_one (input of type Natural and output of type Natural)
-- = is specifying the expression of add_one
-- read aloud we would say
-- the name add_one, whose type is Natural -> Natural, is equal to the expression \x -> x + 1
-- the expression defines the behavior of a function, it starts with a backslash, \, and extends all the way to the right
-- this is called a lambda expression
-- the expression, \x -> x + 1, can be read out loud as the function whose input we name x, and whose output is x + 1.


-- a fundamental difference between types and expressions is the time when they exist
-- type checking is performed as part of the compilation process of our program so if type-checking fails then
-- compilation will also fail
-- the expressions exist when the program is executed, known as run time

-- anything that can exist at runtime is an expression of some type
-- in the book, does type in the sentence above refer to the type of the data or is it saying anything that exists at
-- run time is some type of expression? Ambiguity throwing me off there.
-- I think in this case it means anything at run time is an expression that has a formal type

-- value, expression, and term can be used interchangeably ("more or less")

-- this is how a function is called with inputs in Haskell, apparently
-- in Haskell we want to use the word "apply" instead of call
-- I assume this has to do with the concepts in functional programming that I will learn more about later on
-- We're not calling add_one and inputting 3, we're applying add_one to the Natural 3
add_one 3

--this should return 4. Is this really the syntax?

--this is how we assign the output of add_one to a new term. In this case four is now equal to the
-- application of add_one on the input 3
four = add_one 3

-- the type checker would tell us though that add_one 3 results in an expression of type natural
-- four :: Natural

-- the type of four is Natural
-- the expression of four is add_one 3


--we can also use Haskell this way
-- putting the expression directly in the term assignment inside of parentheses
four = (\x -> x + 1) 3

-- we could also do this
four = (\3 -> 3 + 1) 3

--the above is accidentally "correct"
--we're not actually applying the 3 outside of the parentheses, we've hardcoded the values. The 3 at the end does nothing

--we could also just do
four = 3 + 1

-- going from an expression to just 3 + 1 is called a beta reduction, stylized as  Î²-reduction.
-- Beta reducing (\x -> x + 1) 3 results in 3 + 1 NOT \x -> 3 + 1

--we can make expressions of expressions
-- chain add_one three times to get add three
add_three :: Natural -> Natural
add_three = \x -> add_one (add_one (add_one x)))

--Season can only ever be one of the four values specific, Wintter, Spring, Summer, or Fall.
--These are called the constructors of the season type because only by using one of those can we construct a value

--The above function doesn't compile? Why. Lets think about this before reading on in the book to see if we can understand
--Since Haskell is exhaustive in its type checking and we must know all possible input types, this will fail because
--we are not accounting for every possible string input because there are (near?) infinite string inputs
--we probably need a default case/else type handler in the function to handle all unknown inputs, but then
--we do not have an output type of Season that would correspond to unknown.
--At this point we might be able to add an 'Unknown' Season but maybe there is an error handling option instead
--that would return something that is usable in the runtime that is just an error message that would not crash the program
--Can programs in Haskell return 2 possible data types? String -> (Season OR TRY_AGAIN).
--Maybe you need to construct an additional data type that is Season_Result that returns the season and/or the result of
--the season to handle errors.
--Just thinking critically and ahead instead of having the book spoonfeed me everything and zoning out.
--Finaly prediction, we need to add some sort of catch all to the case AND handle the error in some graceful way
--because the default won't be able to match to a season


--Surpsingly the book says to just make a new data type for Temperature:

data Temperature
    = Cold
    | Warm
    | Hot
    | Chilly

--then define temperature_to_season as
temperature_to_season :: Temperature -> Season
temperature_to_season = \x ->
    case x of
        Cold -> Winter
        Warm -> Spring
        Hot -> Summer
        Chilly -> Fall

--This also makes sense, it just isn't the direction I expected the book to go. This leaves me wondering, does Haskell
--have default case statement abilities? Is there a graceful way to handle unknown inputs and errors on the output?
--Surely there are but maybe not, maybe the point of Haskell is to never do this under any circumstances.


--Ah, now it seems we're getting into handling errors or default cases
--we use the Maybe keyword
--I find this hilarious given the other rigid seriousness of the language
--we also have a Just is a constructor I am trying to understand

data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

string_to_temperature :: String -> Maybe Temperature
string_to_temperature = \x ->
    case x of

        "hot" -> Just Hot
        "chilly" -> Just Chilly
        _ -> Nothing

--_ is a wildcard symbol that will result in Nothing
--but the Just part...
--We're applying Just to the temperature data type.
--However it is not modifying the value in anyway.
--I'm still confused as to what Just is doing here even after reading.
--Is it a neccessary part of the Maybe?
--is data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a creating a type constructor to pass arbitrary types to?
--Can we do Maybe Season and get back Nothing or Just Season?
--Hoping going further into the book explain this or I get more examples
--Hopefully by continuing on I am not short changing myself

--Moving on though, we have another sum type in Haskell called Either to say something must be either this or that
--coming back to this I am not sure anymore. I think data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a is actually needed and it is
--defining our usage of Maybe

data Either x y = Left x | Right y

--The book notes left and right are insignificant and Haskell doesn't care about the names.
--Does this mean Just was invented above simply to wrap the type in? It is not a native reserve word in Haskell?
--Can I do anything in that case, e.g. data Maybe a = Nothing | Thisisjustawordforanything a? Confusing.
--Reading more on stackover flow it seems liek Just is a specifi keyword that must accompany Nothing, sort of an
--inverse null to show that we must return either Nothing (null) or the expected data type.
--So I do not believe data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a has anything to do with the strting_to_temperature function
--the maybe portion there is defined in the defintion and since we're using maybe we have to use just in the actual
--expression.
--I think I understand now but correctness of my understanding is hard to know until I do some actual examples or
--write some of my own code.
--However this doesn't seem to be the case with Left and Right in the Either example.
--Left and Right could be anything as long as they are consistent.

--But it is common to reuse the name of the type constructor as the value constructor.

--A sumtype can be called a coproduct. The co prefix in coproduct means it is the dual of something. In coproduct
