-- the expression defines the behavior of a function, it starts with a backslash, \, and extends all the way to the right

-- a fundamental difference between types and expressions is the time when they exist
-- type checking is performed as part of the compilation process of our program so if type-checking fails then
-- compilation will also fail
-- the expressions exist when the program is executed, known as run time

-- anything that can exist at runtime is an expression of some type
-- in the book, does type in the sentence above refer to the type of the data or is it saying anything that exists at
-- run time is some type of expression? Ambiguity throwing me off there.
-- I think in this case it means anything at run time is an expression that has a formal type

-- value, expression, and term can be used interchangeably ("more or less")

-- this is how a function is called with inputs in Haskell, apparently
-- in Haskell we want to use the word "apply" instead of call
-- I assume this has to do with the concepts in functional programming that I will learn more about later on

-- the type checker would tell us though that add_one 3 results in an expression of type natural

--The above function doesn't compile? Why. Lets think about this before reading on in the book to see if we can understand
--Since Haskell is exhaustive in its type checking and we must know all possible input types, this will fail because
--we are not accounting for every possible string input because there are (near?) infinite string inputs
--we probably need a default case/else type handler in the function to handle all unknown inputs, but then
--we do not have an output type of Season that would correspond to unknown.
--At this point we might be able to add an 'Unknown' Season but maybe there is an error handling option instead
--that would return something that is usable in the runtime that is just an error message that would not crash the program
--Can programs in Haskell return 2 possible data types? String -> (Season OR TRY_AGAIN).
--Maybe you need to construct an additional data type that is Season_Result that returns the season and/or the result of
--the season to handle errors.
--Just thinking critically and ahead instead of having the book spoonfeed me everything and zoning out.
--Finaly prediction, we need to add some sort of catch all to the case AND handle the error in some graceful way
--because the default won't be able to match to a season


--Surpsingly the book says to just make a new data type for Temperature:

data Temperature
    = Cold
    | Warm
    | Hot
    | Chilly

--then define temperature_to_season as
temperature_to_season :: Temperature -> Season
temperature_to_season = \x ->

--This also makes sense, it just isn't the direction I expected the book to go. This leaves me wondering, does Haskell
--have default case statement abilities? Is there a graceful way to handle unknown inputs and errors on the output?
--Surely there are but maybe not, maybe the point of Haskell is to never do this under any circumstances.


--Ah, now it seems we're getting into handling errors or default cases
--we use the Maybe keyword
--I find this hilarious given the other rigid seriousness of the language
--we also have a Just is a constructor I am trying to understand

--_ is a wildcard symbol that will result in Nothing
--but the Just part...
--We're applying Just to the temperature data type.
--However it is not modifying the value in anyway.
--I'm still confused as to what Just is doing here even after reading.
--Is it a neccessary part of the Maybe?
--is data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a creating a type constructor to pass arbitrary types to?
--Can we do Maybe Season and get back Nothing or Just Season?
--Hoping going further into the book explain this or I get more examples
--Hopefully by continuing on I am not short changing myself

--Moving on though, we have another sum type in Haskell called Either to say something must be either this or that
--coming back to this I am not sure anymore. I think data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a is actually needed and it is
--defining our usage of Maybe

data Either x y = Left x | Right y

--The book notes left and Right are insignificant and Haskell doesn't care about the names.
--Does this mean Just was invented above simply to wrap the type in? It is not a native reserve word in Haskell?
--Can I do anything in that case, e.g. data Maybe a = Nothing | Thisisjustawordforanything a? Confusing.
--Reading more on stackover flow it seems liek Just is a specifi keyword that must accompany Nothing, sort of an
--inverse null to show that we must return either Nothing (null) or the expected data type.
--So I do not believe data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a has anything to do with the strting_to_temperature function
--the maybe portion there is defined in the defintion and since we're using maybe we have to use just in the actual
--expression.
--I think I understand now but correctness of my understanding is hard to know until I do some actual examples or
--write some of my own code.
--However this doesn't seem to be the case with Left and Right in the Either example.

--add_ones = \xs -> map add_one xs can be rewritten as
-- add_ones = map add_one
-- another example is that
-- f is the same as \x -> f x
-- when the input and output are the same then you do not need to add them to the lambda expression
-- This is called pointfree style of defining a function.
-- This is just a syntax difference. Unclear on the benefits as of now but for now the book says htat it improves
-- readability in some situations when removing or adds clarity when writing the more verbose form.
--"this has its roots in the concept of 'Eta-conversion', stylized as n-conversion, which says that this is possible"
--I don't understand the implications of this sentence, it seems tautological to say that it has roots in a concept that says it is possible
--maybe it will be elaborated on later
--however the more verbose form is called the n-expanded form but it is apparently okay to forget this?


--returning to add_ones = map add_one
--the map is only "partially applied" inside of the pointfree definition of add_ones
--this is because not all of th parameters the map was expecting have been provided yet, only part of them have


--In Haskell partial application works because when there is a function type like:
-- a -> b -> c -> d
--is, in reality, a function with a type like this:
-- a -> (b -> ( c -> d))
-- In Haskell there is no function taking more than one parameter, all functions take only one parameter in Haskell.
--They immediately return something right away.
--It is just that sometimes the thing a function returns is another function, so we take a mental short cut and say
-- a -> b -> c -> d
-- but a -> b -> c -> d is not a function that takes three parameters as input and returns d as an out put.
-- a -> b -> c -> d is actually a -> (b -> (c -> d)) that takes a as an input and returns
-- a function b -> (c -> d) as an output
--which takes b as an input and returns a function c -> d
--the paraentheses are rarely written down, but they are always there.


--something similar happens when a lambda expression is used to define a function
--we write something like \a b c -> d when a function is written that takes more than one parameter as an input.
--but we have acknowledged that taking more than one parameter is not actually a think in Haskell, so what is actually happening?

--\a b c -> d is magic syntax for writing:
\a -> (\b -> (\c -> d))

--because people find this ugly.
--And since the parentheses are unneeded as well it could also be written as:
\a -> \b -> \c -> d


--chapter 31 lost me a little bit with partially applying add function (with type Natural -> Natural -> Natural) using map
--I believe the point being driven home is that the following:
[3, 4]
map (add 1) [2, 3]
map add_one [2, 3]


--all mean the same thing because map (add 1) [2, 3] would add on to each element in the list.
-- map :: (x->y) -> List x -> List y

-- I am hoping more examples will be clarifying for me. I need something meatier to sink my teeth into.
--Learn better by doing, usually.

--reminder that our type definition of map is:
map :: (x -> y) -> [x] -> [y]
--and we could make our expression:
map = \_ _ -> []

--in this case the input is discarded and a list [y] is returned. This passes the type checker definition.
--but this is not what we wanted the map to do, it is just passing type checking.
--we need more to ensure that our function works as we expect
--we need to convey that something can be 'mapped over' without actually saying what that something is

--typeclasses
--typeclasses represent a class of types that supports some particular operations.
--in the case of 'mapping'we will concern ourselves with the class of types in which we can find values of a particualr
--type that can be replaced by values of a potenitally different type.
--this is what our map funciton did, but by specifying lists with the brackets it was made more concrete, which we do not want (Why?)


--Haskell comes with a built in function called fmap that solves this problem:
fmap :: Functor f => (x -> y) -> f x -> f y
--when comparing fmap to our list map:

map ::               (x -> y) -> List X -> List y

--they are very similar. f has replaced all instances of List and we have a new keyword, 'Functor' which is describing something about 'f'

--the Functor to the far left of the => is 'constraining'
--Functor is the typeclass in question. Functor f is saying that the f type parameter appearing to the right of the
-- => symbol can be any type as long as it belongs to the class of types that implement the features required by the Functor typeclass.
--Functor is just the name we give to these things that can be mapped over, such as Lists.


--What is 'Functor'?
--Functor is a built in typeclass in Haskell. But reproducing it for learning:

class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

--This notation is creating a new typeclass, as indicated by the class keyword.
--f is a place holder for any type that implements what the Functor typeclass requires.
--What is the requirement for Functor?

Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b



--The class of types that can be mapped over are called the Functor class
--To be part of the Functor class, the type must implement the fmap method.
--When a function is declared as part of the type class it is called a method instead of a function


--Given all of the above, does a 'type f' belong to multiple class types? If we have a typeclass called:

class SillyFunction f where
    silly :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b


--Can 'type f' also belong to SillyFunction class type if it implements both silly and fmap? I assume so from what
--I am reading. So types can belong to multiple classtypes that have different requirements for being part of the class type
--Do types opt into being part of that classtype or do they just become part of it once they meet the requirements of
--required implementations?
--This feels like it will have large implications for the structure of programs in Haskell that I am unable to grok at this juncture

--The connection between typeclass 'Functor' and the List type we made, we create an 'instance'
--in this instance we have implemented fmap for the List type
--To be more precise, according to the book, we have implemented the instance of the Functor typeclass for the List type
--There can only be one instance of a particular typeclass for a particular type.
--e.g. we can't have two instances of Functor for List

--Ah, yes, what I wondered earlier has been stated explicilty.
--'f type' can have many instances of different type classes.
--So all typeclasses must be opted into by the instance keyword. Without implementing an instance of a typeclass
--a type is not part of that typeclass.

-- Functors are expected to satisfy the following laws:

--    fmap id == id

-- Composition law:
--    compose (fmap g) (fmap f) == fmap (compose g f)


--when saying something like
-- 2 * 3
--the * is a function
-- and since it appears BETWEEN the parameters instead of before them (eg * 2 3)

--for now we will say the type of * is Natural -> Natural -> Natural
-- but that is obviously simplified for now

--doesn't work
* 2 3

--does work
(*) 2 3

--any time an infix function is not placed BETWEEN the parameters it must be enclosed in parentheses
--when done this way it is in a 'prefix' position
--this term is not often used though because the default 'fixity' of a position is prefix when
--we define a new function or constructor
--this means we just assume functions are in the prefix condition by default unless told otherwise

--because f must be a type, Maybe Natural is not a type because maybe type to maybe type isn't telling us anything

--this is correct, as maybe is a type

--in the above the left parameter in the () is left unchaged, we simply return the same value for it
--But I confess I am a little lost

--saying it out loud is
--given a value of type Either x a as input, fmap modifies the a somehow, if any, possibly change its type
--but leave the x untouched

--for example

fmap add_one (Left 2)

--results in the same Left 2
--but

fmap add_one (Right 2)

--results in Right 3

--this is the definition, again, of Either, which is comprised of
-- Left X or Right y
data Either x y = Left x | Right y
